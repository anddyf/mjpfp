/ npm i everything in module
/ You will need a database called 'calendar'
/ You will also need to seed using the script "seed" npm run seed. The seed will take a while so you need to wait until it finsih seeding (7 seconds more or less)
/ Once the seed is finish, you can run the server using script "start:dev" npm run start:dev (7 seconds more or less)
/ If you want to review the test spec, which is basically checking if the sequelize is working, use script "test" npm run test.*( Once you run test, you must run "seed" again to run "start:dev" )

( Everything else should be simply to follow. If your calendar isn't fully loaded, rerun "start:dev" and wait a few seconds and it should work fine in your localhost. )
